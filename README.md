### Hi! Welcome to my Github and Stackexchange activities(tik9.github.io)
<br><br>

### What is this site about?

Off the top of my head: 
It is about..

.. myself:
- Javascript Developer
- Full Stack Developer

It is also about..

..showing my Github and Stackexchange activities.

I think both companies do their job well, each in its way:

Github is complex regarding user interaction and you have several possibilities including a static site for each repo. Although I must admit I never did much on Bitbucket, which should be worthwhile inspecting. But for another day..

Stackexchange is an independent company and does a good job regarding social coding. I post and comment here and there where I can.

### Things I learn while making the site
- I still get to know Jekyll in-depth and someday will dive into Ruby. But, for another day..
- I continue learning JS
- I improve my VSCode skills - a tool I will not miss
<br><br>

### Things I miss
Python! Python..? Yes, Python. 

But the essence: this website is done and based around a static site gen, so be calm, Timo, and go for other (Python) projects if you like Python.
